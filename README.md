[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is a hosting platform that works very well with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - because it's their framework! In this lesson, we prepare our project to be deployed to production by:

- Pushing code to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Deploying repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- Updating [GitHub OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers) to use production URL
- Updating [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project to use production URL
